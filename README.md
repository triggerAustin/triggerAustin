# 👋 Hey, I'm Austin

I'm a software developer who builds with intention—clean code, real impact, and no noise.

I’m currently focused on:
- ⚙️ Full-stack JavaScript (React, Node.js, MongoDB)
- 🎯 Building robust, scalable APIs and user-first UIs
- 📁 Working on an AI-powered document retrieval & correlation system
- 🔐 Exploring secure, efficient architecture for practical, real-world tools

## 📌 What Drives Me

I don't just write code—I build tools that solve real problems.  
I'm not in this for noise or likes. I'm here for growth, impact, and mastery.

If it doesn’t push me, I don’t pursue it.
